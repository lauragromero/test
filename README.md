Technologies Used
	•	React 

ReactJS
	•	I decided to use React given that the exiting markup for the page was easily decomposable into its components and React best supports the declarative way of writing HTML using JSX.
Requisites completed
	•	Decompose the markup in components or whatever it suits you better to make it a 		production ready App
	•	Implement the shopping cart logic with the following requisites:
		⁃	Add/Remove product card items using the +/- buttons.
		⁃	Calculate the totals of each product and the summary total accordingly.
		⁃	All totals in order summary should be updated whenever a product is added or 		removed

**Besides providing exceptional transportation services, Cabify also runs a physical store which sells (only) 3 products:**

The current prices of the products are the following:
```
Code         | Name                |  Price
-------------------------------------------------
TSHIRT       | Cabify T-Shirt      |  20.00€
MUG          | Cafify Coffee Mug   |   5.00€
CAP          | Cabify Cap          |  10.00€
```

Our top UI engineer has already made an initial implementation of the store with vanilla html and css, but it lacks the implementation

## Challenge

**Using the framework/library of your choice you have to:**
- Decompose the markup in components or whatever it suits you better to make it a production ready App.
- Implement the shopping cart logic with the following **requisites**:
  - Add/Remove product card items using the +/- buttons.
  - Calculate the totals of each product and the summary total accordingly.
  - All totals in order summary should be updated whenever a product is added or removed.

**Take into account the following aspects:**
- Have notes attached, explaining the solution and why certain things are included and others are left out.
- Deliver production ready code.
- Provide a solution that could be easy to grow and easy to add new functionality.
- You can add any UX / UI improvements you consider, but we are going to focus on the requested features.
We value succinctness.
- When in doubt, act as a product owner

**Bonus Points**

There are bonus points. That means that are not mandatory, up to you if you want to implement them (one or both) or not.

1. Product Detail modal
  * Our UI engineer hadn't time either to work on the product details modal which you can see in the `/bonus` folder. It would be a plus if you could implement it.

2. Discounts
We would like to add some discounts to our products. Choose one or both and add them in your implementation:
  * 2-for-1 promotions: buy two of the same product, get one free, applied to `MUG` items.
  * bulk discounts: buying 3 or more of `TSHIRT` product, the price of that product is reduced 5%. E.g., if you buy 3 or more `TSHIRT` items, the price per unit should be 19.00€.
